The following script minikube.sh works by allowing you to set your configuration options before spawning a kubernetes cluster.

options include:

- config, allows us to setup popular minikube configuration items listed here: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/commands/config/
- view, allows us to view the config.json file that is located at $HOME/.minikube/config/config.json
- run, runs the minikube cluster.
    - nodes <N> allows you to start minikube with multiple nodes overriding the default value of 2, a master + control plane node and a worker node.
- start, starts the cluster, for example run ./minikube.sh start <MINIKUBE_CLUSTER_NAME> to start a previously stopped minikube cluster.
- list-clusters, lists the available minikube clusters or Profiles.
- stop, stops the minikube cluster for example run ./minikube.sh stop <CLUSTER_NAME> to stop a previously started minikube cluster

if no options are passed to the script than this document is show.
